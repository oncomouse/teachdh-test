Whether you want to create a digital edition, digital archive, or any other site (for that matter), you can make use of a general website maker like WordPress, but we like to capture high-quality images or convert a picture of a text with plain text with[OCR with GoogleDocs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/drive/answer/176692&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699423391&usg=AOvVaw0zYtqwaCJgC8JHgYpLVwy8), Microsoft Lens, Text Scanner, Adobe Scan, Smart Lens, or our favorite, [ScannerPro](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://readdle.com/scannerpro&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699423553&usg=AOvVaw2xGp1GyrXkpW_I62DaZ5QP) (check out [our ScannerPro assignment materials](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-a-practical-introduction/assignment-sets&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699423817&usg=AOvVaw3RZR7SQjgK8RgqENOu0SDX) and also [our activity materials related to it](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-a-practical-introduction/classroom-activity-sets&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699424059&usg=AOvVaw3xfywADDQqAxArOEQdqS1M)), then add light encoding with the Markdown editor [Dillinger.io,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dillinger.io/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699424203&usg=AOvVaw2VffJeHI-qV1lsj_akIi46) an in-browser WYSIWYG Markdown editor, and use [GitHub pages to create a website with your resulting Markdown-encoded text](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699424403&usg=AOvVaw0aHZK4KchxRWyw1NvAmCgH). For a full workflow, check out [our Digital Edition assignment materials](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-a-practical-introduction/assignment-sets&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699424640&usg=AOvVaw3sSaxvX6wNc5TEd1NuWxid); for a good warm-up exercise in which students must evaluate existing resources (and therefore generate priorities and values for their own projects!), check out the Digital Archive Review materials or Mediated Textuality Essay materials, located in the same place as the Digital Edition linked to just above. Note that long-lasting, peer-reviewed, and/or grant funded digital editions tend to be encoded in [TEI-XML](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tei-c.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699424873&usg=AOvVaw32cD8QOpHq1y6FTqLOzIBm) (not Markdown, the HTML preprocessor we recommend for beginners).
