First, decide if you are asking students to annotate texts (such as course readings or blogs), images, or videos, and then refer to the appropriate materials below:

*   Textual Annotation:[Hypothes.is](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.hypothes.is/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699421767&usg=AOvVaw0SUqnHLnRaDfx4MMgvKXpE) is a popular service that students may be able to use in other contexts, but [Perusall](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://perusall.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699421938&usg=AOvVaw2qB4PfmnSQmDNdbDsD1lz9) is a new favorite in the DH community because users can annotate a number of media formats. Keep in mind that some CMSs already have built-in integration with these services
*   Image Annotation:[Flickr](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flickr.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699422220&usg=AOvVaw1zO6AqEmwfI63JWk1sV_7L) (or, for more sophisticated options, [ThingLink](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thinglink.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699422375&usg=AOvVaw27QFq7_W7-2QJjB-0vqlgw)); also note that the Canvas CMS now has built-in annotation tools for PDF files
*   Video Annotation:[Video Ant](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ant.umn.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699422622&usg=AOvVaw36Hb3ytjp3EC984hbiaCZG) (you could also review [our assignment sheet and rubric for using VideoAnt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://scalar.usc.edu/works/digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-a-practical-introduction/classroom-activity-sets&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699422821&usg=AOvVaw1n94iSsLicTKBd16Gtwg3V))
