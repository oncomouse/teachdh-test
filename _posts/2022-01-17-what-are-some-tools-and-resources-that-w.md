*   For synchronous online teaching, Claire has used [Padlet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://padlet.com/dashboard&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699482987&usg=AOvVaw2F1HuhQxIFIJ9qBsQnfEj2) boards, Google [Jamboards](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jamboard.google.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699483164&usg=AOvVaw3Ef_mP6bAFFGYSkQsE1c1v), [Miro](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://miro.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699483311&usg=AOvVaw3BL1OCSLk68qFk6RnO1HHq) Boards, and collaboratively created [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/slides/about/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699483452&usg=AOvVaw3OHFyxdJ-Cf3KxxDqX0YZT), particularly in Zoom breakout rooms, as note-taking platforms that allow for real-time digital collaboration among students in synchronous sessions. By watching the notes or images appear on these boards, it is possible to manage the timing of the breakout rooms seamlessly and pull the students back to the main room when most of their work is done.
*   For larger synchronous classes, the [Poll](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699483787&usg=AOvVaw3uo_u0QvFwigjNsNALFjMw) feature in Zoom can be very helpful for a quick response from a large group. Note that it must be set up in advance of the class with the question so that you can share it quickly: otherwise there will be a delay while you set it up.
*   For slides, we tend to use use [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/slides/about/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699484061&usg=AOvVaw06tsencV3OtIh0oNcjrnF8), [Canva](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.canva.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699484220&usg=AOvVaw0Oz58HDK2ciKvClYD2usaw), or [PowerPoint](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699484442&usg=AOvVaw2o_ZY0LgGyLNow-x0EDevm).
*   For general resources and advice, many institutions and organizations have developed guides, resources, and tutorials to facilitate online teaching (see [this one](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://acue.org/online-teaching-toolkit/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699484750&usg=AOvVaw3qsd_rXXlopz4lqeXfMUg6) for example from ACUE (the Association of College and University Educators))
