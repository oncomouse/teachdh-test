“Alternative-academic,” or alt-ac, jobs are great opportunities for graduate students who gain some proficiency in DH as they earn their degrees. Unlike traditional tenure track jobs, the majority of working hours will be spent in service roles, like training faculty, running workshops, and advising scholars who want to use a digital tool for their research. They may be housed in libraries, interdisciplinary units, or DH centers, and they can be even more exciting than a traditional post for many scholars, but some positions may be temporary or contingent on soft money.
