We like browsing [the winners of the annual DH awards](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dhawards.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699341857&usg=AOvVaw10Bn7EmQandlP-IqIMYzXx) and keeping up with the latest issue of [Reviews in DH](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699342003&usg=AOvVaw0f5wzyTDJmsSi5PpbmUd58). To look closer to home, you can DH projects hosted by your home institution by searching for library guides created by your university libraries. You can also venture further afield by browsing the websites of digital humanities associations, such as [EADH’s Projects site](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eadh.org/projects&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699342172&usg=AOvVaw2cRYFAviFWhdxHEMY4f8-2).
