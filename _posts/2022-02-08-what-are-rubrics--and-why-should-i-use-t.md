Rubrics are grading aids in the form of tables that identify criteria for student success in a graded deliverable. They attach a point or percentage value to a range of outcomes (from unsatisfactory to excellent) and describe the characteristics that might make a student’s work fall into a certain point or percentage range for each criterion. Space is often made for instructors to add further comments, either for the project as a whole or for each of the defined criteria. We like rubrics because of the anxiety with which both teachers and students approach the topic of teaching non-traditional assignments. Rubrics let students know in advance exactly how they’re graded, and you will be confident that you are grading equitably.
