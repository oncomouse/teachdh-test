DH was originally very much a self-publishing field, with blog posts on personal websites being a major medium for exciting research. Now, you can still get some attention with well-edited blog posts, but there are also plenty of established book series and journals (which we discuss separately, below). Edited collections are popular places to publish work on DH pedagogy, so be on the lookout for Calls for Papers issued through academic organizations (like the [Humanist Discussion Group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhhumanist.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699475989&usg=AOvVaw3gtAkwPeBnR7PYU35VdfKI) and listservs in your own humanities discipline and subfields), and aggregators like the [UPenn CFP list](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699476163&usg=AOvVaw1fISp2xwASYcuwhGnnteBP). DH book series include the University of Minnesota’s venerable[Debates in DH](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699476513&usg=AOvVaw0bApQxf_TlRXEAZkGr3RNq)series and [Manifold Open-Access Librar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://manifold.umn.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699476676&usg=AOvVaw0XDdw8QYIpCo-w20GvXcJk)[y](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://manifold.umn.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699476776&usg=AOvVaw3kRl1BcDNOoA6ghdXtPdxb) platform, the University of Michigan’s [Digital Humanities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM167&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699476936&usg=AOvVaw3DtYwTi10DrrklkZjBk4SF) series, the University of Illinois’s [Topics in Digital Humanities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/find_books.php?type%3Dseries%26search%3DTDH%26page%3D1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699477170&usg=AOvVaw0jjS3Z_y5jIDO9mZQJwnmS) series, Routledge’s [Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Research-in-the-Arts-and-Humanities/book-series/DRAH&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699477393&usg=AOvVaw3uK9ojzfof9h2d3iXPWBrd) series and [Research in Digital Humanities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Research-in-Digital-Humanities/book-series/RRDIGH&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699477590&usg=AOvVaw2ZMo8BPC9rnqpCSnSMssLW) series, while publishers that are very DH-friendly include [Open Book Publishers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699477739&usg=AOvVaw3xQrp4zDr9QkccwcT0A_Us) and our own [Bloomsbury Academic](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/academic/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699477911&usg=AOvVaw00q_nz2Qb59DqwxVPq3Od4).
