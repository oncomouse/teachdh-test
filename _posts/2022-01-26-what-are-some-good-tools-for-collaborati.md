*   For collaborative writing, Shawna and Claire have composed their book (and the text for this web companion!) in [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699462639&usg=AOvVaw1FXPtjrdvPJL3yAmUx0snV). This eliminates concerns about version control and allows for real-time co-authoring.
*   For project management (including to-do lists, team correspondence, file sharing, and calendars) a host of possibilities exist. We address the many options and their pros and cons in a table in our chapter in the book on collaboration, but Claire has used [Basecamp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://basecamp.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699463136&usg=AOvVaw3A7Z16FY5lwTWjSa2PIqES) and [Trello](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trello.com/en&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699463360&usg=AOvVaw0u64Cf3siwZJGkUDfqs9qx), primarily.
*   For collaboratively gathering resources or bibliographies, our reference manager of choice is [Zotero](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zotero.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699463756&usg=AOvVaw0WfgjMGU0BWWEAz9F02MO5) which allows for Shared Libraries.
*   If you intend to create a website for your project, you could start with Quinn Dombrowski’s [guide to choosing a platform](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/blog/13/12/04/choosing-platform-your-project-website&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699464277&usg=AOvVaw3RukrME9_no4x1_yMqx2Tg).
