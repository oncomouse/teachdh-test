There are so many such collections now (even more than in 2017!) that there is likely to be a collection for almost any subject that might interest you. So here are some general ideas: for accessing digital collections, you can either go directly to a particular library or archive’s own resource, such as the [Harry Ransom Center’s Digital Collections](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699361137&usg=AOvVaw3D9FrDYLtP3l7rARBzbMsf), or a digitization project such as The [Sinai Palimpsests Project](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://sinaipalimpsests.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699361293&usg=AOvVaw2juangMBS0PZm7gn4RTpwm) (or an equivalent library or archive in your own field of study). Alternatively, you can check out some of the larger organizations that aggregate materials from a number of participating institutions, such as [Google Arts and Culture](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artsandculture.google.com&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699361470&usg=AOvVaw2DBxTtv2VvnQ751HKnIKmC). Some cultural institutions have specific pedagogical resources (such as [The British Library Discovering Literature](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bl.uk/discovering-literature&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699361662&usg=AOvVaw2aH4rbx3aO84XCfxwynPPo) series). It can also be useful to have students seek and find their own examples of digital collections and to assess them critically using approaches such as the one described [in this blog post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hastac.org/blogs/galen-bunting/2021/02/02/teaching-digital-archive&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699361866&usg=AOvVaw2kGrwjHas748_zOXGk7kau) by Galen Bunting. These student-driven resource searches can help students consider questions of inclusion, representation, and mediation. If students aren’t able to readily locate a digital archive on their topic of interest, why might that be? And what might you and your students be able to do to address any gaps you might find?
