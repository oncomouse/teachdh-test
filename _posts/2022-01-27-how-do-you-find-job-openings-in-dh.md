Many higher education institutions will try to advertise positions at the [Chronicle of Higher Education](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jobs.chronicle.com/jobs/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699459247&usg=AOvVaw1dQXKpkZydZ_blhTALbu25), [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://careers.insidehighered.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699459568&usg=AOvVaw30SRJLYpSOwziBW7ExITzl), and the [Times Higher Ed](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/unijobs/en-us/listings/europe/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699459939&usg=AOvVaw0dzAZAfdf2axN5odeTNJHE); see [a full list of academic job databases here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.eui.eu/programmesandfellowships/academiccareersobservatory/jobfundingresources/internationaljobdatabases&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699460327&usg=AOvVaw1Ce1uvHIPj4rBr4dVNgOmq). Each year, a webpage on the [Academic Jobs Wiki](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/Academic_Jobs_Wiki&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699460629&usg=AOvVaw3UnwfJoMyaDIXytAF98jYu) is created that tracks jobs in New Media and Digital Humanities ([view the 2021-2022 instance here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://academicjobs.fandom.com/wiki/New_Media_and_Digital_Humanities_2021-2022&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699460979&usg=AOvVaw384Z7Tj7vwPQPnPwY43aAi)). Subscribe to listservs in your field and in DH to keep track of new openings; the most popular DH listserv is the [Humanist Discussion Group](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhhumanist.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699461240&usg=AOvVaw2OVZZgB2w82zVHgeZrQBiu). Open positions are frequently tweeted out by DH insiders, and you’ll want to keep your finger on opportunities within your own institution that are being advertised by your library and/or DH center, which might include postdoctoral fellowships, directorships or associate directorships, program coordinators, systems administrators, communications specialists, project managers, pedagogy liaisons, and software/application developers.
