As with conference presentations, most humanities fields and subfields now welcome DH-inflected work, so if you want to publish something that is focused on digital pedagogy methods that are specific to your field/subfield, browse the latest issues of your favorite “regular” journals to see if they’re open to DH work. There are, of course, plenty of great DH-focused journals. Most are open-access (free to read!), most welcome a wide variety of types of publications (from traditional articles to tool reviews to case studies and even pedagogical materials), and most of them have a global approach that welcomes authors from all around the world. The caveat here is that the world of DH journals is fast-paced; you might have your article published with amazing speed, but you might also find out that your favorite journal is on hiatus or only accepting special issues. Fortunately, Dennis Tenen, Alex Gil, and Vika Zafrin maintain a current list of [“DH- and New Media-friendly Journals.”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/dh-notes/dhnotes/blob/master/pages/journals.md&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699478516&usg=AOvVaw2UPog5cDHHCBxMG1rbLYCT) That said, here are some DH journals to read and consider submitting to:
