In our first Web Companion we offered a tutorial on using [ScannerPro](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/how-to/ocr-software-convert-pdf-to-text.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699359605&usg=AOvVaw1fTWKnmXWj2cWe5-DGUc1E) as a mobile-friendly way of creating digitized texts for use in the classroom. We have found that phones are the most accessible hardware for this purpose for most students. Though we have both used ScannerPro, there are many such apps and we are agnostic about which one is best (one of our students recommended [Microsoft Office Lens](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.microsoft.office.officelens%26hl%3Den_CA%26gl%3DUS&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699359884&usg=AOvVaw0g2iQa0xGDgnxKiqn8qOZf)). Basically what you will need for scanning and creating digital texts is a scanner and/or camera and a tool to run Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This second step renders the text machine readable and is very useful for any kind of text analysis using tools like [Voyant](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://voyant-tools.org&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699360072&usg=AOvVaw1ldaqTfLFePp1S_lpyppmh). Some of the scanning apps include OCR capabilities within the app. If you don’t want to download a specialized app, you can use your phone camera for photos to which you can apply [Google Cloud](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/tutorials/ocr&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699360264&usg=AOvVaw3dto_x6o2boSo9zPr1Hyht) or [Adobe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/how-to/ocr-software-convert-pdf-to-text.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699360458&usg=AOvVaw3YYRZin35YG7BU0EsJNYj7)tools to run OCR. It is important to note that correcting the OCR generated automatically by any of these software services will be important: there are likely to be errors! This can be a very helpful exercise for students as well as long as the text is not too long: it can show students the possibilities and limitations inherent in the machine reading of texts.
