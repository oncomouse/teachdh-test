Character network graphing visualizes relationships between characters to reveal which ones are more or less fully connected with one another. Eduhacker has published [an innovative and (relatively!) fast workflow](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.eduhacker.net/technology/create-network-graphs-google-fusion-tables.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699412007&usg=AOvVaw0aQ8XL7EhTHtv_RhzU42KO) for creating these network graphs by using Google Fusion Tables. For general data visualization, [Tableau](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tableau.com/academic/teaching&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699412203&usg=AOvVaw2Q4LA2DwcB2uojnPuv-hWX) has a relatively straightforward learning curve. Miami University also hosts [this helpful list](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g%3D957684%26p%3D7057570&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699412393&usg=AOvVaw33OfA_oq30Hu-q1nJKNqtY), with the tools categorized by level of difficulty.
