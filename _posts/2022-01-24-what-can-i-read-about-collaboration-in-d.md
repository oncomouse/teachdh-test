Collaboration is increasingly both a practice and a topic in DH. There are many good articles on this topic, including this survey by Gabriele Griffin and Matt Hayler in [DHQ from 2018](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/12/1/000351/000351.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699467428&usg=AOvVaw00W6QO_Zza7noeDjwI6ExV). [This essay collection](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.routledge.com/Collaborative-Research-in-the-Digital-Humanities/McCarty-Deegan/p/book/9781138254510&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699467833&usg=AOvVaw3fmdBdrX6sRekRmPX5hSKI) (Collaborative Research in Digital Humanities ed, Deegan & McCarthy) is a bit older but contains several different and still-relevant perspectives on engaging in collaborative practices and models in this discipline. For an essay that addresses the notion of the ‘lab’ and considers collaboration as a situated practice, try [“Lab and Slack”](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/14/3/000485/000485.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699468451&usg=AOvVaw1VsQYFRW4iWA2Qt914GoS9) (2020) by Oiva and Pawlicka-Deger, and for a consideration of affective communities in collaborative practice, try this collaboratively authored article, “[One Loveheart at a Time](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/14/3/000474/000474.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699468796&usg=AOvVaw1WF21FONlRu2oUnSS19cK1)” by the Old Books, New Science Team.
