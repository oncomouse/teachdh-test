In an online synchronous setting, the results can be shared through screen-sharing. Students might even be tasked with creating their own "kahoot" (their own modules), which would encourage peer-to-peer learning. [AnswerGarden](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://answergarden.ch/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699405519&usg=AOvVaw1813-22-Anc7c7Xj4Acq45) allows you to enter in a question, while the other users answer them, and AnswerGarden automatically generates visualizations of their answers. For online synchronous courses, there’s always the trusty [Zoom poll](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-meetings&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699405708&usg=AOvVaw2WmakNJXOvgbrOlRI9N-0U). If you’re looking for a fun slightly gamified activity, you could try course-related trivia games created using [Twine](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twinery.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699405848&usg=AOvVaw2kvbZ4len6dH6Z8yf_VWxe) or [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/?utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dna-CA-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-%257Bmatchtype%257D-dr-1011401%26utm_content%3Dtext-ad-none-any-DEV_%257Bdevice%257D-CRE_%257Bcreative%257D-ADGP_Desk%2520%257C%2520BKWS%2520-%2520EXA%2520%257C%2520Txt%2520~%2520Forms_Google%2520Forms-KWID_43700063916285044-%257Btargetid%257D%26utm_term%3DKW_%257Bkeyword%257D-ST_google%2520forms%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwxtSSBhDYARIsAEn0thS-tmMLfpKkSWD5hlLwH-g6uWBvSR4PqvFMPtO8SzYv10nqQr66miAaAss-EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699406269&usg=AOvVaw2Es9nkwdUiPchm4MRgJbhM).
