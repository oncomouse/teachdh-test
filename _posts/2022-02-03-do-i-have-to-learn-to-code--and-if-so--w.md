Maybe not, if you have only have one or two specific things you want to do with DH (say, to map an interactive map or create a course website), but probably yes if you want to be a fully-rounded DH scholar. In our book, we suggest that if you or your graduate student wants to become a DH scholar or seriously integrate DH into their future career, we suggest not only to become familiar with the basics of “XML, HTML, Markdown, databases, and CSV (comma-separated values) tables, and to learn good file management techniques,” but also to learn [the programming language Python](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.python.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699440040&usg=AOvVaw0llsXQbyiC493DsGBiqh6g) and put [GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://github.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699440200&usg=AOvVaw2G_eTf2JxJTE5lt4kfd9wu) and [Stack Overflow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stackoverflow.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699440586&usg=AOvVaw293qo-Clf6koQKwVeX8C1W) to good use in composing and managing their code.
