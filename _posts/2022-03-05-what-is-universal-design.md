Universal Design is an accessibility standard that demands equitable use, flexible use, and simple and intuitive use. [North Carolina State’s Center for Universal Design](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699362585&usg=AOvVaw3-es1HirHSufPwC5-fanBZ) maintains useful resources, including a straightforward set of [Principles for Universal Design](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699362826&usg=AOvVaw3iX5sbDFoNB2GrumJrymTK), but you can also directly seek information about [Universal Design for Learning](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://udlguidelines.cast.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699362981&usg=AOvVaw23ijCWm7xAU4hD2mFugl1Q) more specifically. These practices should animate everything in your course—from the content you assign to the assignments they complete and from your lecturing practices to your expectations for participation—so that every student has an equal opportunity to flourish in your class without any last-minute, ad hoc accommodations. To design an accessible course, you must ensure multiple means of representation (which affects how students access course content and communicate with you and other students), multiple means of expression (how students demonstrate their mastery of course concepts and content, especially for the purposes of grading), and multiple means of engagement (how students can interact with course content, so they may stay motivated throughout the semester). You might find useful resources within your institution to support the implementation of UDL (at C’s institution this is available through the [Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teaching.utoronto.ca/teaching-support/udl/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699363203&usg=AOvVaw2IlCAfvjgjw4S1foSwUTnI), which also has a great public website with lots of useful resources. For analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of UDL by DH practitioners, see articles by [George H. Williams](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/2a59a6fe-3e93-43ae-a42f-1b26d1b4becc&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699363537&usg=AOvVaw1ZiviQHVOM8jBe2GnFNDsZ) and by [Rick Godden and Jonathan Hsy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.disruptingdh.com/universal-design-and-its-discontents/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699363852&usg=AOvVaw1NgyMbbCiDgihGOkMm6dX4).
