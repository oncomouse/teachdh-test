In Chapter 10 of our book, we identify multiple ways that your digital humanities pedagogy experiments can contribute to your research:

*   By becoming itself a subject for publication: publish your teaching experiments by narrativizing them into a “case study” article, which summarizes the activity or assignment you created (using plenty of detail about your unique course, institution, and student body), shares your materials (tutorials, assignment sheets, rubrics, even sample student work), explains its strengths and weaknesses, and teaches other instructors how to do it in their own classrooms
*   By inspiring a broader research project about your favorite DH pedagogical method: build upon your specific, concrete experiences by doing research on the educational merits of your favorite tool or project and creating a more universalized argument about DH pedagogy (less rooted in your personal experience than the “case study” model, discussed above)
*   By streamlining or supplementing the way you organize your data and write your publications: let your new DH skills enhance your current humanities research processes by making them more efficient (a citation manager can simplify your record-keeping, for instance, while database services can help you keep track of your data)
*   By revolutionizing your research methods and research questions: recast your research questions, make your publications more multi-dimensional (supplement your writing with compelling visualizations, statistics, tables, or interactive datasets)overhaul your fundamental methods for conducting humanities research by adapting computer-assisted techniques for accessing and assessing your primary sources
*   By adjusting the scope your research: embrace the most radical potentialities of DH by applying your favorite humanities method or theory to studying computer technologies and digital cultures or, conversely, by redefining crucial concepts in your field and reframing your own subfield in terms of what computational methods can reveal about your primary sources
