*   For recording videos of screen-sharing (for example to show students a web resource or to record over slides), we like [Loom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loom.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699485317&usg=AOvVaw3mpCyXoBpAsE9ZOVY0izeu), because it allows students to still see your face. For general video recording of lectures, a very simple setup of just your phone camera (perhaps with one of [these portable tripods](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://joby.com/ca-en/gorillapod-flexible-camera-tripods/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699485610&usg=AOvVaw1tb42zVDO8oMZd44KB_9wz)) works just fine.
*   Remember that for asynchronous videos it helps a great many students to provide transcription (this service can be done [automatically through Zoom](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Managing-closed-captioning-and-live-transcription&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699486010&usg=AOvVaw28DptOW9Fmfqai0CWQLwuB) and then corrected, but there are also many examples of similar voice to text softwares, which we discuss in our chapter “Ensuring Accessibility”).
*   Students often enjoy and appreciate a community chat to exists alongside their asynchronous course such as [Slack](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slack.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699486336&usg=AOvVaw1SlwWvQFGhSk5Uz7Kfpy1u) or [Discord](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699486544&usg=AOvVaw1Qnjtal8bu7qeNA_NemTR_). You can either participate along with them and use it to share resources, or suggest that they create such a space for themselves as a way of forming community amongst fellow students during remote learning.
*   For recording podcasts, we like the [free, open-source Audacity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.audacityteam.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699486851&usg=AOvVaw2oOQ0Xtd_rucMyOuOeKSzw), which is simple and therefore relatively easy to learn, but you can even use [GarageBand](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699487115&usg=AOvVaw2qRSrXoEW-EVKU0BxYYhCk) (or one of [these Windows alternatives](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://producerhive.com/buyer-guides/daw/free-garageband-alternatives/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699487317&usg=AOvVaw0zf38a9qhwSpZtY04V1yxX)). Using a real microphone will astronomically improve your results and don’t have to be expensive ([S uses this $25 Monoprice USB version](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id%3D600202&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699487511&usg=AOvVaw00HK8cnr7T6c41D60nPchV)).
