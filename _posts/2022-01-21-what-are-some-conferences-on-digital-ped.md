Conferences devoted to DH are hosted by many DH-centric academic organizations, many of which belong to the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adho.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699473889&usg=AOvVaw05d4OxM8jwtdyfIibCgHwD). ADHO itself also hosts the[annual DH conference](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adho.org/conference&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474076&usg=AOvVaw2ATZDuFfMkb2ZpqKk13pRr), which rotates among a variety of locations across the globe and (depending on world conditions) occurring online. There is also an annual conference devoted just to DH pedagogy—the wonderful [Digital Pedagogy Institute](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uwaterloo.ca/digital-pedagogy-institute/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474239&usg=AOvVaw3iKDLxYpkKT5WkKlNDKJ_-), which has been held since 2014—and [the Digital Pedagogy Lab](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://digitalpedagogylab.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474400&usg=AOvVaw37EtACen9s8S2_QJuuoACp) is another opportunity, though it often resembles more of a workshop than a traditional conference. DHSI holds its annual [Conference and Colloquium](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhsi.org/colloquium/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474536&usg=AOvVaw1NtfOFZ7kPDXXy6Tkp7xZd) every June, and they welcome digital pedagogy scholarship. In the past, approachable, informal unconferences called THATCamps were great places to get started and find people near you who are interested in DH; [the organization has recently disbanded](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thatcamp.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474756&usg=AOvVaw2BZd3_d9Ppr0Myu0TYHxEt), but you could certainly organize a similar gathering yourself and find collaborators in ADHO organizations, on Twitter, on the [Humanist listserv](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhhumanist.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699474921&usg=AOvVaw0Jno3jaOiEytaPDp4tU4vZ), or through working groups or institution-based listservs that serve your local community. The news isn’t all bad, though, as DH is increasingly considered a “normal” method of scholarship, which means that you will likely find opportunities to present your work at whatever academic organization conference you would normally present at.
