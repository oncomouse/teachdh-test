In addition, [IVONA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nextup.com/ivona/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699364865&usg=AOvVaw1pwtiqQtrNW7QiMmOiVDlu) is a crowd-sourced alternative, and [Google Cloud’s “Speech to Text”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699365026&usg=AOvVaw1K-gx_9TPgbxiXNnDgxDjh) is a serviceable free option.
