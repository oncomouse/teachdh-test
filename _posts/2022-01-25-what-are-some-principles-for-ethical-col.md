The go-to on this topic is the “[Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:31187/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699465349&usg=AOvVaw3iJLK_Iro7-KdGq66sNsGc)” and the student-specific “[Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://humtech.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699465713&usg=AOvVaw323lGsl7EyoEqo7B86huNI).” It is also helpful to read first-hand student accounts of both the benefits and pitfalls of collaborative experience, such as Rachel Mann’s [2019 piece](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/ea501a60-dd3c-4c22-a942-3d890c3a1e72&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699466198&usg=AOvVaw0MHa6OP52kYPISEivfygz0) and this [2020 special issue of “Digital Studies”](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/7368/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699466503&usg=AOvVaw3h3aYw2Yu-Hd3pN22TXR_H)
