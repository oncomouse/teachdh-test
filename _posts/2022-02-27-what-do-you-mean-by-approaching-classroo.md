Learn more about this approach from this Ted talk from [Michael Wesch](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DLeaAHv4UTI8&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699389439&usg=AOvVaw0uVzZhyY5zfIEGBFQO77t6), and find ideas for implementing them in this chapter by [Eileen Gardner and Ronald G.
