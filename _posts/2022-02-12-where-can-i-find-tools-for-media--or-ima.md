*   Born-Digital Genres: Experiment with listicles, quizzes, Pinterest boards, Instagram feeds, and webcomics by asking your students to pick their own preferred genre of creating web content; we recommend making storyboards with [MakeBeliefsComix](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://makebeliefscomix.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699420883&usg=AOvVaw24OrMoXVRZ9En4mNMnVu2R), [Pixton](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pixton.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699421007&usg=AOvVaw2-UWrfjB6ssYhlL78VVDBU), or [StoryBoardThis](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.storyboardthat.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699421134&usg=AOvVaw1_rW5usmAOnJAIE3VOV3vY)
