There are many different digital archives out there of varying scales and scopes and many more than we can list here - a good starting point is to contact your institutional liaison librarian and/or your local archives and ask about digital collections and holdings. Large corpus gatherings such as [Google Books](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://books.google.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699348839&usg=AOvVaw1T6fUZYlT5CfLe7soJf13U) and [Project Gutenberg](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gutenberg.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699349151&usg=AOvVaw3Fw17YvjrkSIoWzLihEjKl) are the most obvious resources, but it’s worth being transparent with your students about the strengths and limitations of these massive resources in terms of accuracy and quality control. Other massive resources are the [Internet Archive](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://archive.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699349460&usg=AOvVaw0i9Xr00Co-NYaf65brlhDg), the [Digital Public Library of America](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dp.la/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699349671&usg=AOvVaw2cGiSmOQVHTgt8Aklmk2JR), the [Library of Congress Digital Holdings](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.loc.gov/collections/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699349909&usg=AOvVaw0AaittwALfNOaW9zHmymWE), [The British Library](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bl.uk/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699350150&usg=AOvVaw1-24aGdqH-qAvlBIabrJzi)’s many digitized collections, and [HathiTrust](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.hathitrust.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699350443&usg=AOvVaw3MaYUg8gjwILjTH9_JtC74).

There are also paywalled historical digital archives provided by publishers such as [EBSCO](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ebsco.com/products/digital-archives&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699351379&usg=AOvVaw2LK8b8V9sNzexoa1nDp1BQ) and [Adam Matthew](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amdigital.co.uk/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1649984699351614&usg=AOvVaw0zaUXW9YOFZ9bcxKztLZgh) to which your institution might subscribe.
